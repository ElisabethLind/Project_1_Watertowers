# Project_1_Watertowers

## Data I used: 
 - Self Reported Drinking Water Tnak Inspection Results: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Self-Reported-Drinking-Water-Tank-Inspection-Resul/gjm4-k24g 
- NTAs: https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page 
 - population development NYV 1800 - 1900: https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2021.S0101?q=New+York+city,+New+York+2021 

## Workflow: 
 - Dataanalysis in VS Code (pnadas, matplot) 

## Map 
 - Geojson produced with geojson.io 
 - Visualization in Adobe Illustrator 
 - ai2html (didn't work properly*) so I decided to export every layer as an jpg  - you can see the project in my repository project_watertowers

## Graphics 
- Cleaning in Excel
- Visualization: Datawrapper 

## Text, photos and Video by me 

## HTML 
I used the scrollytelling-template (images) by Jonathan Soma: https://github.com/jsoma/page-templates



* I really tried to figure out what's the problem, because the first image is always the wohle AI-File with all layers on - altough my png is just the basemap as you can see it in my github-respository. So if anybody has an idea - please tell me! :-)
